            <p class="topic">Rebel Poet</p>
            <p class="parah">Nazrul had a diverse upbringing, exposed to both Islamic and Hindu cultures, which later
                influenced his thoughts and writings. He was a voracious reader and self-taught, mastering several
                languages, including Bengali, English, Persian, and Arabic. His extensive knowledge allowed him to
                compose poems and songs that were intellectually rich and emotionally resonant.Apart from being a poet,
                Nazrul was also a prolific songwriter and composer.Nazrul is celebrated as the "Rebel Poet" due to his
                fierce and revolutionary writings, </p>

            <p class="topic">Awesome Writer</p>
            <p class="parah">Nazrul's poetic works encompass various genres, including patriotic songs, ghazals, nazms
                (free verse), and love poems. His poetry was marked by its emotional intensity, fiery imagery, and
                strong symbolism. One of his notable works is "Bidrohi" (The Rebel), a revolutionary poem that became a
                symbol of resistance against oppression. His poetry often challenged traditional norms and advocated for
                a more inclusive and egalitarian society.Every year, his birthday is celebrated as "Nazrul Jayanti" in
                both countries, where people pay tribute to his contributions to literature, music, and social
                consciousness.</p>
